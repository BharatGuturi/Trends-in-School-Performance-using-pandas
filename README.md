# Trends in school performance using pandas
To make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

## Instructions
Input files can be accessed using the following path:
PyCitySchools --->Resources

Working file can be accessed using the following path:
PyCitySchools ----> PyCitySchools_Working

The csv file (school_data_complete) placed in the "PyCitySchools" folder is the merged data of "schools_complete" and "students_complete"

The Questionnaire can be accessed using the following path:
PyCitySchools ----> PyCitySchools_starter

These are the steps for some of the questions:
Step 1: Data frame has been created in table format across all students which contains "Total Schools", "Total Students", "Total Budget", "Average Maths Score", "Average Reading Score", "%Passing Maths", "%Passing Reading", "%Overall Passing".
    Passing score is 50

Step 2: A "School Summary" table was created in table format from the School summary groupby data (groupby based on School name) which contails the columns " School type", "Total Students", "Total School Budget", "Per Student Budget", "Average Maths Score", "Average Reading Score", "%Passing Maths", "%Passing Reading", "Overall Passing".

Step 3: Top performing schools were sorted based on "Overall Passing %"

Step 4: Worst performing schools were sorted based on "Overall Passing %"

The code and execution for the remaining steps in "PyCitySchools_Working" file.

To run the solution, clone the repo using command:
    Git clone https://github.com/BharatGuturi/Trends-in-School-Performance-using-pandas.git

Execute the file "PyCitySchools_Working"
